WiderHub
=========

###A Chrome Extension for full width GitHub PRs.
This extension makes your github PR's full screen. It's ghetto but it works. 

##### Installing it

Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and drag the WiderHub.crx file into that window. Hit Add. Go to github. The little button tells you its working. You can hide it, it doesnt do anything.  

###### BUT I DONT USE CHROME

Just add the inject.js script to greasemonkey or whatever other tool you typically use to accomplish tasks like that.
